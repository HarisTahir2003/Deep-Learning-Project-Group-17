# Deep Learning Project

This repository contains four Jupyter Notebooks implementing and comparing deep learning approaches for automated analysis of chest X-ray images. The models focus on segmenting lung regions and classifying the presence of Tuberculosis (TB) using a combination of CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures. Specifically, the repository includes:

1. **SENet** – A SEResNet50-based classifier trained directly on preprocessed raw chest X-rays.
2. **UNet++** – A segmentation model that isolates lung regions for cleaner downstream classification.
3. **UNet++ + SENet** – A two-stage pipeline where UNet++ segments lung areas, followed by SENet classification on the segmented output for improved diagnostic performance.
4. **Swin Transformer** – A Vision Transformer model applied to chest X-ray classification to explore attention-based learning.

Each notebook includes detailed preprocessing, training logic, evaluation metrics (Dice, IoU, classification reports), and GradCAM++ visualizations to interpret the model’s decision-making. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining segmentation and classification, and explores the use of Transformers in medical imaging.


The repository contains the following files:

* **UNetPretrained.ipynb** – Trains a UNet++ model for lung segmentation.
* **UNet.pth** – Saved weights of the trained UNet++ model.
* **SEResNet50.ipynb** – Classifies TB from chest X-rays using SEResNet50.
* **SEResNet50.pth** – Saved weights of the trained SEResNet50 model.
* **UNet\_SENet\_Pipeline.ipynb** – Combines UNet++ and SEResNet50 for segmentation-based classification.
* **SwinTransformer.ipynb** – Applies a Swin Transformer for TB classification.

Dataset folders used in the notebooks:

* **Image-Segmentation/** – X-ray images and masks for segmentation.
* **Dataset2/**, **Dataset3/**, **Dataset4/** – X-ray images for TB/Normal classification.

## Introduction

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric classification and regression algorithm. It works by finding the k closest training examples to a given test point and making predictions based on these neighbors. For classification, KNN assigns the class most common among the neighbors, while for regression, it averages the values of the neighbors. <br>

A regression tree is a type of decision tree used for predicting continuous outcomes. It splits the data into subsets based on feature values, aiming to minimize variance within each subset. The process continues recursively, creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents a predicted value. Regression trees are useful for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between features, but they can be prone to overfitting if not properly pruned or regularized. <br>

 This assignment provides a clear and concise example of how to implement the KNN and Regression Tree algorithms from scratch using Python.

  - A text file  `(training_data.txt)`containing the robot's coordinates, with 30 values recorded for each second (since video is 30 fps).

## Lessons

An AI project such as the one implemented here, involved many challenges, including:

1. **Handling Time Series Data:**
   - **Challenge:** Working with time series data requires careful consideration of the temporal order and dependencies between observations. This can be tricky when predicting future values based on past data.
   - **Solution:** To manage this, I implemented a lookback mechanism, which involved using previous observations to predict future values. For both KNN and Regression Tree models, this allowed me to capture temporal dependencies effectively.

2. **Implementing KNN from Scratch:**
   - **Challenge:** Building the KNN algorithm from scratch without relying on libraries like scikit-learn involved creating functions for distance calculation, finding nearest neighbors, and handling ties in predictions.
   - **Solution:** I wrote custom functions for Euclidean distance and nearest neighbor selection. To handle ties, I implemented a mechanism to decrement k until a clear prediction was obtained, ensuring robust and accurate results.

3. **Evaluating Model Performance:**
   - **Challenge:** Choosing the right value of k for the KNN model and the lookback size for the Regression Tree model required extensive evaluation. The performance needed to be assessed using metrics like RMSE.
   - **Solution:** I plotted RMSE values against different k values and lookback sizes to identify the optimal parameters. This involved iterating through various values and analyzing trends to select the best-performing configurations.

4. **Handling Model Complexity and Overfitting:**
   - **Challenge:** With increasing model complexity (e.g., higher k values or longer lookback periods), there was a risk of overfitting, where the model might perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.
   - **Solution:** I monitored performance metrics across various configurations and chose parameters that balanced model complexity and generalization. For KNN, I observed the trend in RMSE with varying k values, and for Regression Trees, I tested different lookback sizes to find the optimal trade-off.
