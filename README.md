## Introduction

This project includes implementing and comparing deep learning approaches for automated analysis of chest X-ray images. The models focus on segmenting lung regions and classifying the presence of Tuberculosis (TB) using a combination of CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures. Specifically, we train the following models:

1. **SENet** â€“ A SEResNet50-based classifier trained directly on preprocessed raw chest X-rays.
2. **UNet++** â€“ A segmentation model that isolates lung regions for cleaner downstream classification.
3. **UNet++ + SENet** â€“ A two-stage pipeline where UNet++ segments lung areas, followed by SENet classification on the segmented output for improved diagnostic performance.
4. **Swin Transformer** â€“ A Vision Transformer model applied to chest X-ray classification to explore attention-based learning.

Each notebook includes detailed preprocessing, training logic, evaluation metrics (Dice, IoU, classification reports), and GradCAM++ visualizations to interpret the modelâ€™s decision-making. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining segmentation and classification, and explores the use of Transformers in medical imaging.

## Project Overview

Our project was executed over a period of approximately 1.5 months and consisted of the following five main phases:

#### 1. **Dataset Collection**

In this phase, we conducted extensive research to identify suitable datasets for our project. We curated a large collection of over 10,000 chest X-ray images from three different Kaggle datasets for classification tasks. Additionally, we sourced a dataset of 704 chest X-ray images with corresponding masks to train and evaluate our image segmentation models.

#### 2. **Baseline Model**

As our baseline, we implemented a **pretrained UNet++** model for lung segmentation. This model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 96%, providing a strong foundation for downstream classification tasks.

#### 3. **Improved Release**

In this phase, we developed a **SEResNet50** model â€” a Squeeze-and-Excitation ResNet architecture â€” for TB classification. The model demonstrated excellent performance, achieving 99% classification accuracy, along with strong results across all evaluation metrics.

#### 4. **Final Release**

We introduced a two-stage pipeline, where the UNet++ model first segmented the lungs, followed by classification using the SEResNet50 model. This integrated approach achieved an impressive 99% accuracy. Additionally, we experimented with a Swin Transformer, exploring transformer-based architectures for medical image classification. The Swin Transformer yielded strong performance, achieving a test accuracy of 96.28% and a test loss of 0.2156. Overall, the Swin Transformer achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.9627, indicating its effectiveness as a transformer-based alternative for TB classification.

#### 5. **Research Paper**

We concluded the project by writing a comprehensive **research paper** detailing our motivations, dataset preparation, methodology, model architectures, results, and analysis. This document serves as a complete overview of our approach and findings.
